          Stories are the essence of existence. What is a sentence except a tiny
          story? They are how we understand our experiences, create meaning,
          learn and bond. There are stories of all sorts here - fiction, ESL
          resources, audiobooks, and tales yet to be crafted. Good Studies and
          happy reading!

            dictated them to her Grandma, filling volumes of notebooks. For the
            last 20 years, she has taught English as a Second Language, and her
            passion for words has inspired her throughout. Throughout that time,
            she has also continued to create works of fiction in all genres.
