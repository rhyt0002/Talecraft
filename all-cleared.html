                <h2>More about All Cleared Up</h2>
                <p>Did anyone ever tell you that Phrasal Verbs are completely random and have to be memorized one at a time?
                    This is not true!
                    All Cleared Up:  explains the Secret to understanding Phrasal Verbs - the Particle.
                    A particle is the second word in a Phrasal Verb - the out in figure out, the up in wake up, etc.  All Cleared Up explains the meanings of particles and shows how English mixes and matches them with verbs.  These skills can be applied to any new Phrasal Verb students learn in the future.
