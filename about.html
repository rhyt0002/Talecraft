                Rhea Black, an ESL professor at Algonquin College and College la Cite, is combining her 20 years of English-teaching experience and her love of writing into one project. Her textbook is entitled <i>All Cleared Up: the Secret to Understanding Phrasal Verbs</i>. It takes the unique approach of exploring the imaginative ways that the second word changes the meanings of verbs. For example, it explains why <i>get up</i>, <i>get out</i>, and <i>get back</i> are different. It also addresses why <i>pick up</i> can have so many different definitions. Finally, it solves the mystery of why an alarm clock can both come on and go off!

              Most learners of English as a Second Language find phrasal verbs difficult because they are so many, so varied, and so boring to learn. For the same reasons, ESL teachers find them a great challenge to teach! Basically, <i>All Cleared Up</i> is the textbook I wish Iâ€™d had when I first started my career.
